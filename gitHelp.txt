# To set up the git repo:
cd to parent directory for repo
> git clone https://github.com/TimTwigg/121WebCrawler

# make a new branch
> git checkout --track -b <branch name>

# push changes to branch
# the commit will open an editor and ask for a commit message
# you can also run it as ' git commit -m "<message>" '
> git add .
> git commit
> git push -u origin <branch name>

# after the first push to the branch, you no longer need the flag on the push command, so it becomes:
> git push
